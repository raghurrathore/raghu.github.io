Introduction: Language and literacy  are major domains of early childhood development.         They involve development of the skills used to communicate with others through languages         (language development), as well as the ability to read and write (literacy development). An         example of language and literacy development in childhood learning is to speak the native lan-         guage of one’s parents and read basic words in that language. This type of development begins         from birth, even though bab ies are not yet able to speak using language.           LANGUAGE has been defined as “a system of symbols that is used to communicate.” Relat-         ed to this, bilingualism is the ability to speak at least two languages. Children are born with         the brain capacity to learn language because it is an innate feature of the human brain. The         brain regions responsible for language development are Broca’s area which controls speech          production, and Wernicke’s area, which controls the understanding and cognitive processing         of language.           Language develops through children’s literature with other people around them. For e.g., a         baby hears his/her mother talk directly to him/her, as well as to other people. Hearing the         mother’s speech may encourage a baby to try to imitate the sounds that he/she hears over time.         Furthermore, the baby will quickly learn which words are connected to certain objects or peo-         ple, and which words may produce responses from others.            LITERACY is defined as the ability to read and write. Like language, literacy experiences         with others. In early childhood, for example, literacy can develop through hearing stories,         reading from books and showing children pictures with words. It is important that adults do         not attempt to force adult levels of reading onto children in their early development, as this is         considered developmentally – inappropriate and may actually work against healthy develop-         ment. For example: a child who is pushed to learn to write too soon may come to connect the         activity of writing with failure and disappointment.            › Ways to support language and literacy development in early childhood:           Pg 12 | Relations between language and literacy","These are simple ways that adult caregivers can help support the language and literacy devel-         opment within early childhood. One way to do this is through books. The following tips help         support children’s healthy development:              •  Incorporate books and reading into daily routines, like a part of a child’s bedtime ritual.             •  Remember that very young children may not have the attention span to sit through                 long books; reading a book partially is still helpful.             •  Use all forms of verbal expression to read to children, including reading, singing and                conversing about the content of books.             •  Connect the stories found in books to the child’s life.             •  As babies get older, show them the words that you are reading, as you read them.             •  Keep children engaged in reading by asking them questions along the way, or letting                them tell stories.             •  Keep in mind that what  young children like in books in different than what older                children like; for example, books with bright colours, large print, and lots of novelty                 are more appealing to young children.           CONCLUSION: Language and literacy are major domain of early childhood development.         These are connected area, but refer to diff. things. Language development involves the de-         velopment of the skills used to communicate with others through languages, while literacy         development involves the ability to read and write. Babies are born with the capacity for de-         velopment in these areas. These are simple ways that adults can support this development. In         addition to understanding basic behaviours adults should also be aware of common communi-         cation disorders, which may impede language and literacy development.

Oral language is one of the most important skills your students can master – both for social and         academic success. Learner’s use this skill throughout the day to process and deliver instruc-         tions, make requests, ask questions receive new information and interact with peers.           As a teacher, there’s a lot you can do during your everyday lessons to support the development         of strong oral language skills in students. The teaching strategies can help students with spe-         cific language disabilities (including dyslexia), and they can boost the language skills of other         learners, too.           (i)    Encourage conversion : Every social interaction gives students a new opportunity to         practice language. So of your students might need a little guidance from you to engage in          conversations, so spark interactions whenever you can. Ask questions, rephrase the student’s         answers, and give prompts that encourage oral conversations to continue.           (ii)   Model syntactic structure : Students may not use complex oral syntax in informal         speech, but encourage them to do so when they’re in the classroom. When a student uses frag-         mented syntax, model complete syntax back to them. This builds oral language skills and give         students practice in a skill necessary for mastering written language.           (iii)  Maintain eye contact : Engage in eye contact with students during instruction and en-          courage them do the same. Maintaining eye contact will help learners gauge their audience’s         attention and adjusted their language, their volume or the organization of their speech. This         will help them be better understood, communicate more clearly and successfully interpret         non-verbal cues about their clarity.           (iv)  Remind students to speak loudly and articulate clearly : Ask students to feel the         muscles used for speech while they’re talking and monitor their volume and articulation. Re-         mind them that clear and loud-enough speech is essential for holding the attention of the group                                            Ways \& means of development of oral language skills | Pg 15","and communicating their info and opinions (not very noticeable) effectively.           (v)    Explain the subtleties of tone : Students have probably experienced playground argu-         ments related to tone, mis-understandings are common when students are using loud outdoor         voices. Remind your students how tone of voice – which includes pitch, volume, speed and         rhythm – can change the meaning of what a speaker says. Ask students to be mindful of tone         when they’re trying to get a message across and adjust their volume and bitch accordingly.           (vi)  Attend to listening skills : Ensure that students are listening by using consistent cues         to get their attention. Teacher might use a phrase like. “It’s listening time” to give students a         reminder. Some students might also benefit from written reminders posted prominently on the         wall.           (vii)  Incorporate a “question of the day” : During each school day’s opening activities, ask         a question to encourage talk. Start with simple one-part questions like “What is your favour         animal?” If a student doesn’t answer in a complete sentence, model a complete sentence and          ask the student to repeat your model. Once the students answer simple questions, move to         2-part questions that require more complex answers : “What is your favourite animal ? Why?           (viii)  Compile a class booklet of student’s phrases : Give students a sentence to finish, such         as “When my dog got lost I looked …” Have each student contribute a prepositional phrase to         complete the sentence (e.g., at the grocery store, in the park, under the bed). Then have your         students create a class booklet by writing and illustrating their phrases. When all the phrase         pages are assembled into a booklet, students can practice reading the very long a sentence with         the places they looked for the dog. Encourage them to come up with a conclusion to the story.           (ix)  Questions to boost comprehension: Asking questions before and after a reading as-          signment not only helps sharpen oral language skills, it also helps students think about what         they’re reading and absorb info from the words. You might try the following strategies to fa-         cilitate reading comprehension:           “Where does the story begin ?” What kind of story or article is this ?           Ask students to predict outcomes : “What will happen ? How do you know “?           Have students summarize the passage : “Who were the characters?” “What was the plot?”          “What was the outcome?” “What was the main idea?”           (x)    Never assume students understood your instructional talk : You use oral language         everyday to teach – but some students may not be getting your message. Be aware of the po-         tential disconnected between what you say and what your students hear. Go over your message         and present it in multiple ways to be sure all students understand.           (xi)  Teach concept words : Some students may have difficulty with abstract concepts such         as before, after following and with sequences such as days of the week or months of the year.         To help students learn and retain these concepts you may need to prevent and review them           Pg 16 |  Ways \& means of development of oral language skills","many times and in multiple ways. For example;           You might ask students to identify which holiday comes in each month and then review holi-         days for other months in a sequence;           “Republic day is in January, what holiday is in March” ?         “May is before June and after April.”          “May is between April and June”.           CONCLUSIONS : Oral language is one of the foundational building blocks of learning. Give         students the boost they need for future academic and social success.

Early years settings design language-rich environments to help children develop speech and         language skills. Understanding how children develop these skills helps us understand why the         environment is so important.            Children learn speech and language when adults talk to them, by listening, watching, babbling,         exploring, copying, responding, interacting and playing with others. From the age of 2, chil-         dren are learning 10 new words a day on average, so by the age of 6, they have almost 15000         words in their vocabularies and then they speed up !           There is no one right way for a child to learn or a designated time for them to begin to speak-chil-         dren reach speech and language development milestones in diff. ways.           It is an almost universal truth, that when children start speaking they expect to be understood         ! Children can often be frustrated when adults don’t grasp their meaning immediately – even         when ‘up’ can mean ‘down’, ‘I want to go outside’ and ‘put me in the car’ sometimes all at the          same time.           For ECE, the ability to speak and understand a child’s tongue is a skill often undervalued by         non- educators. This skill is especially important for educators who are caring for children         with diff. home languages from their own.           Educators who share a child’s language attempts with parents/guardians can often ease a young         child’s frustration as the adults in their life create a shared context.

Role of rich language learning environments | Pg 19","Engage children in conversation about things that interest them – TV cartoons, cars etc.         For a start, the walls of a childcare service don’t need lot of posters of words and numbers to be         language rich. Exposure to print and letter/letter sounds can happen without filling walls with         words. That doesn’t mean no words at all labels and words in context with learning activities         are fantastic – but posters with lists of ‘sight words’ in preschool just make busy walls – pack         them away.            Both the quantity and quality of words that are spoken to children from 12-36 months that have         an impact on their language development.              › Key factors for language development in early childhood education           (i)    Children learn when adults talk to them : Talk about play, talk as you set up learning         activities and talk through daily routines as you go about your day. Listen to the children’s         interest and engage with them. It’s about conversations, not just counting or listing things (col-         ors, animals) or reciting the alphabet. Talk through activities as you do them and ask questions.            (ii)   Language is more than just words : Make the interactions positive, look at the child         as they are speaking to you and if possible get down on their level for conversation. Children         who feel they are being heard, grow in confidence. Remember that learning to talk is about         more than words. Body language, smiling and back and forth interactions are all important for         language and speech development.          (iii)  Give children space to talk : Children need you to wait white they try out new lan-         guage. Be conscious of facial expression as you are listening, show that you are interested.         You may also need to speak more slowly in some instances, often we speak so quickly that the         words can blur for an early learner.            (iv)  Provide many opportunities for imaginative play : Play is such a language rich expe-         rience. The elements of storytelling, dialogue, experimenting, problem solving and interacting         with other children all make play vital for language development.         Books don’t always need words for children to read.           (v)    Read (and tell stories) aloud to/with children : Read books aloud, real brochures,         magazines, read the side of cereal packets … just read. Read simple books, more complex         books. Read books without words. Make up your own stories. The cadences (rhythm) of read-          ing and storytelling are where children learn about grammar, rhythm and rhyme – long before         they learn to say those words.

This can be done by placing labels in the classroom, drawing         blackboards around the wall at the bottom and placing pictures, charts, etc. To motivate the         children to learn the language.           Role of rich language environment in Early Years – Children get the opportunity to learn in          a language rich environment through their daily routine in playing games. In the formative         years, children love to play, it is also easy to teach them through play, such an environment in         the classroom motivates children to learn. Through many indoor games and activities, children         can be taught to read and write in the classroom because it is believed that whatever the student         learns through activities and play is his permanent knowledge.          How to Create Language           Rich Environment         (i)    Charts : In the early years, children learn more by watching. There should be more and         more charts in small classes. Such as charts of shapes, charts of fruits, charts of birds, charts of          vegetables, charts of colors.                                                                                   Figure           Charts of names of organs etc. When the charts are engaged in the class, then when the child         comes to class crying and sees those charts, then the child learns something or the other through         those charts.

If there are pictures of fruits and vegetables on the chairs, then it attracts the children and         also helps in learning, when the child sees those chairs daily, he will also learn the names of         the fruits and vegetables.

Fruit Chart, Vegetables Chart etc.         If there is a label everywhere 4 Games (6). There are different types of games. For example, if         a given a chance to play social games, sports games etc., then every child likes to play a lot in         those games too.           (iv)  Books (Comics) : The rich environment the child plays in the development of children         in the early years. Selecting books according to the level of children, as children are given a         picture book, until they do not know how to read, then they should be given books with letters.          Books provide a good learning environment for children.           Positive feedback for a rich learning environment for children in the classroom, children should         always be given positive feedback on activities. If the child recites some poem, song etc. in the         class, he should always be encouraged, never give negative feedback that you did not do well         or that you cannot do it. It is the duty of a teacher to always encourage his children to move         forward.           (v)    More Conversation : In the early years, children area of curious nature, they have         many questions in their mind, which they want to know, such as- why, how, who, what etc.         Questions roam in their mind. Live, for which they want answers. The teacher should have          more conversations with his children during the class, this will answer the questions of the         children and their vocabulary will also increase and they will increase in their vocabulary, then         their literacy level will also increase.

(vii)  Wall Magazine : Bhiti Patrika is a powerful medium for creative expression of children.         Through this, positive energy is communicated to the children and they are able to express         their mind in a creative way. Under this, articles, stories, poems, sketches, cartoons, drawing,         paintings, good ideas, jokes etc. are described. Under the wall magazine, the work done by the          children is shown on the wall of the class. Whose name has been given to the mural magazine.         Thus, when children see the work done by them on the wall of their classroom before their         eyes, they are encouraged and motivated to learn, the wall magazine enriches the learning en-         vironment of the classroom.

The display         board enriches the classroom learning environment, because when the children see that the         work done by them is displayed on the display board, they are very happy and motivated to         learn. The progress of the children can be tracked by looking at the work displayed on the dis-          play board.

Not all children follow         the exact sequence.           Pre-Linguistic Stage : 0 to 12 Months            The first stage of development in the process of children learning to use language is the pre-lin-         guistic stage. Babies use this stage to learn how to communicate with others.           During the first stage of life, babies rapidly learn how to communicate with their carers so that         by the age of 12 months, most babies understand what is being said to them and are starting to         communicate their needs by pointing or by showing their carer objects.

This is often accompanied by a sound or the beginnings of a word. This         demonstrates an increasing awareness that words are associated with people and objects.         •      Babbling beings to reflect the intonation of speech.         •      May understand simple, single words e.g., bye bye.\\              › 12 Months         •      Babbling becomes more tuneful and inventive          •      Strings vowels and consonants together to make repetitive sounds         •      Use gestures to as for things         •      Enjoy games e.g., peek-a-boo         •      Understand more than they can say         •      Begin to respond to simple instructions.

Linguistic Stage : 15 Months to 8 years           Children starts to use words around twelve months and by fifteen months they have developed         their own word for an object or person and use it consistently. They then go on to use holog-         raphes – using a single word to express several meanings by changing the sound and using          gestures. As they grow children gradually put two words together to form a mini-sentence.

These connect language to actions and help your child’s understanding and memory.         •  Play games involving ‘more’ or ‘again’ which can help develop attention and support lan-             guage too.         •  Toys, objects and books that make a noise can be used to encourage your child’s attention             and listening skills.         •  Talk about everyday activities e.g. putting away the shopping. This helps your child to con-             nect language to the world around them.         •  Use objects and gestures to support your child’s understanding of instructions and ques-             tions e.g. point to their coat when saying “Put your coat on please”.          •  Offer your child choices by showing, them two objects and labelling them e.g. ‘do you want             to teddy or the car ?’         •  Books are a good way to promote speech development - look at pictures together and de-             scribe what they can see. Don’t be afraid to tell a story more than once, repetition helps             your child to understand and remember the language that she hears. ‘lift-the-flag’ books are             also helpful to encourage concentration.         •  Children learn speech sounds gradually - saying the whole word back to your child is the             best way to encourage language and speech development rather than correcting them. It             is also helpful for your child if they can see your face when you are talking to them - this              helps your child to watch and copy the movements that your lips make as you say sounds             and words.         •  Often children can be frustrated when adults don’t understand them - this can lead to tan-             trums. Encouraging your child to use gestures for objects or actions can be useful too. Be             patient, wait for them to finish what they are saying or trying to show you.         •  Sometimes children sounds as if they are stammering trying to share all of their ideas be-             fore their language skills are ready!
